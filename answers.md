- [ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
    I learned how to use built in, third party, and custom middleware. I also learned about how to use routes to separate my project into different files.

- [ ] Describe Middleware?
    Middleware is what powers express. It allows you to make request handlers and to add extra functionality to express. 

- [ ] Describe a Resource?
    A source is anything on a database that a client might be looking for. It could be a list of things such as users or items.

- [ ] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
    Api can return status codes to let clients know what is going on with the request.

- [ ] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
    We can use routing to be able to split up our app into separate parts or sub applications.
